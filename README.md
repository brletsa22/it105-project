## Principles of Programming
Sara Brletrick, a third year student at Juniata College, Vice President of Big Brother Big Sister, Secretary for JC Literary Circle and JC Psych Club. Psychology POE, with a secondary emphasis in Communications. Sara raised in Northern Cambria Pennsylvania, graduated from NC school district in 2022. Following graduating high school, she continued her education at Juniata College in Huntingdon Pennsylvania. She is the daughter of Angela and Andrew Brletrick, and younger sister of Matthew Bugli. 

My goal in this class, as well as other classes, is to continue furthering my education, and growing my skill sets in different areas. I have had a ever-going interest in human behavior and how to explain it, because I believe that so much can be gained from doing so. 

### ***POE: Psychology*** ***Secondary Emphasis: Communications*** 
While I do not have much experience in programming, I find it a very useful skill for anyone to learn about and engage in. I hope to finish this course with even the tiniest more knowledge and skill in programming.

#### Research
I participate in reasearch in my chosen field of psychology through working with Dr. Kyle Jacquess. His lab focuses on sports psychology, motivation within athletes, and performance under pressure or stress.
